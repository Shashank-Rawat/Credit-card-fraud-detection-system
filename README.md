# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## Objective

Utilizing data-driven techniques to build an adaptive fraud detection system that achieves high detection accuracy in credit card frauds.

## Procedures and Results

### Exploration and Research
The project began with an exploration of existing systems and research on credit card fraud detection. This step involved understanding the current methodologies and evaluating their limitations, providing a foundation for the development of an improved system.

### Data Pre-processing and Feature Engineering
Extensive data pre-processing and feature engineering were performed to enhance the model's effectiveness. This included addressing imbalanced datasets using various sampling techniques and detecting outliers in real-world transaction data. These steps improved data quality and ensured the model could handle the complexities of fraudulent transactions.

### Model Implementation and Evaluation
Multiple machine learning and neural network classification algorithms were implemented, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, SVM, kNN, ANN, and LSTM. The performance of these algorithms was assessed using multiple evaluation metrics such as cross-validation, ROC AUC, Precision-Recall, and Confusion Matrix. The most effective algorithm was selected and coupled with a rule-based system to create a robust fraudulent transaction detection system.

### Tools and Technologies
The project utilized Python for data analysis and model development, leveraging libraries such as pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Keras, and TensorFlow. MS-SQL Server was used for database management, while Matplotlib and Seaborn were employed for data visualization.

### Results
The final system demonstrated a significant improvement in detection accuracy and a reduction in false positives, showcasing the effectiveness of combining advanced data processing techniques with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to combat credit card fraud.
